# Problem 1

Collaborators: None

## Part a

1. s
2. a
3. c
4. d
5. b

\pagebreak

## Part b

The edge needs to be 3 or greater, since the vertex removed after a is c, and if this edge is 2 or less it could be removed next (would be tied or less than c at the step after vertex a). The edge also needs to be 4 or less so it will be removed before the b vertex.

If tied vertices are removed in alphabetical order then the constraint on a to d is [2, 4], otherwise the strict bounds are [3, 4].
