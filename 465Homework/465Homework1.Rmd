# Problem 2

## Part a. Prove that if a and b are even, then gcd(a, b) = 2gcd(a/2, b/2)

1. By the definition of even we can state that a = 2n and b = 2m, where n and m are both integers.
2. Using the definition in step 1 we can write gcd(a, b) = gcd(2n, 2m).
3. Since 2 is a common divisor we can also write gcd(2n, 2m) = 2gcd(n, m).
4. Using step 1, we also know that n = $\frac{a}{2}$ and m = $\frac{b}{2}$.
5. Plugging step 4 into the equalities in step 2 and 3 we get gcd(a, b) = gcd(2n, 2m) = 2gcd(n, m) = 2gcd($\frac{a}{2}$, $\frac{b}{2}$). 

Therefore if a and b are both even, gcd(a, b) = 2gcd($\frac{a}{2}$, $\frac{b}{2}$).

## Part b. Prove that if a is even and b is odd, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(a/2, b)

1. By the definition of even we can state that a = 2n, where n is an integer.
2. Using the definition in step 1 we can write gcd(a, b) = gcd(2n, b).
3. Since b is odd, it cannot be divided by 2, so the 2 in the term 2n is unnecessary information (cannot contribute to the gcd). We can then write gcd(a, b) = gcd(n, b).
4. Using step 1, we also know that n = $\frac{a}{2}$.
5. Plugging step 4 into the equalities in step 2 and 3 we get gcd(a, b) = gcd(2n, b) = gcd(n, b) = gcd($\frac{a}{2}$, b).

Therefor if a is even abd b is odd, then gcd(a, b) = gcd($\frac{a}{2}$, b).

\pagebreak

## Part c. Prove that if a and b are both odd and a >= b, then gcd(a, b) = gcd((a-b)/2, b)

1. By the definition of odd we can state that a = 2n + 1 and b = 2m + 1, where n and m are both integers.
2. a - b = (2n + 1) - (2m + 1) = 2n - 2m + 1 - 1 = 2(n-m). This must be greater than 0, since a >= b.
3. a - b is therefore by definition an even number since 2(n - m) can be written as 2x = (a-b) where x is the integer n - m.
4.

## Part d. 

We know that by the defintion of gcd

```{}
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    // input a >= b
    int d = 1;
    if (a == b) return a;
    bool a = isEven(a);  // test parity of variables
    bool b = isEven(b); // unit time
    while (a > 0 && b > 0) {
      if (a is odd and b is even) { // 2 is not a common divisor (part b)
        a = a / 2;
      } else if (a is even and b is odd) { // 2 is not a common divisor (part b)
        b = b / 2;
      } else if (a is odd and b is odd) { // part c
        a = (a - b) / 2; // our input requires a > b
      } else { // both a and b are even, so both can be divded by 2 (as in part a)
        a = a / 2;
        b = b / 2;
        d += 1;
      }
    }
    // d is how many times divided by 2
    // a is non even part of gcd
    return a * 2^d;
}
```

Now let us asses running time. We are assuming testing parity and halving are in unit time, so let's focus on subtraction. As we can recall a positive integer a has at most log(a) bits, and here a is the larger number. Subtraction two n bit integer taskes O(n) time, so here it would take us O(log(a)) time. Therefore the algorithm meets the requirements of the problem.
