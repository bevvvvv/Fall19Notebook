# Problem 1

This problem requires matching classes to fulfill requirements. You could solve this problem by setting up a bipartite graph, where a set A has vertices $S_i$ where S is a class requirement set, and i is the ith class requied in that set. The other set, set B, has classes as the vertices. For the simple example in the problem with x = 2, and S = {B, C, D, F}, A would have $S_1$ and $S_2$ which are both connected to every class in set B = {B, C, D, F}. From here you can run the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm by phrasing this maximum cardinality problem as a flow problem to find the maximum matches. I included an example graph below with more than one set, where it is clear that this can be solved through maximum cardinality matching. (The example graph requires x=2 from S={A,B,C} and x=3 from R={B,D,F}).
