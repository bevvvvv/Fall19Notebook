# Problem 2

## Part a

In BFS it is impossible to have a forward edge, because the algorithm searches breadth first. This means if you start at root node A, then the algorithm will look at all of A's outgoing edges and add the nodes at the other side as children of A. This means the algorithm could not find a node that has an edge with A that is not a child of A, so there cannot be any forward edges in the BFS tree. All edges from A, must a child, so it cannot fulfill the definition we gave for a forward edge: a BFS forward edge leads from a node to a nonchild descendant in the BFS tree. All edges must be a child descendant.

# Problem 4

The method suggested by Prof F. Lake surely works. We can prove this by induction. At a base case we have standard Dijsktra where all edge weights are greater than or equal to 1. We know that Dijkstra works in this case. For our inductive hypothesis let's assume the min edge weight is 1 - k < 0 works with Dijkstra's algorithm if we add k so our min edge weight is 1 - k + k = 1. If we then have an edge weight of 1 - (k + 1) < 0, we would have to add k + 1, which still preserves the relative weights of each edge, therefore the claim that you can transform all the edge weights by a constant to make them positive so Dijkstra will work is a valid method.
