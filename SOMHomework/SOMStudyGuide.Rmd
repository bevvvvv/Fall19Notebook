# Musical Definitions

Please refer to the file on Canvas for the full list of definitions. Below are the definitions the professor highlighted in class.

### Acoustical Beating

The audible vibration created when two or more frequencies, that are not quite in a simple whole number relationship to each other, are sounded together. For example if 100 and 102 Hz are played together you can hear the 2 vibrations per second difference.

### Audiation

"The mind's ear", or the ability to hear previously heard sounds in one's mind.

### Chord

Three or more different pitches occuring simultaneously.

### Consonance and Dissonance

The concept of relatively pleasing sound, due to combinations of particular harmonies, melodic progressions, and/or rhythms. What is consonant or dissonant depends on what is culturally the norm.

### Dynamics

Level(s) of loudness or softness in a piece of music. Italian terms such as forte and piano are used. Adding an "issimo" is a suffix that means even more of that quality and adding "mezzo" means not so much of this. Pianissimo versus mezzo piano.

### Harmony



### Instrumentation

### Melody

### Music

### Note

### Octave

### Pitch

### Range

### Scale

### Timbre

### Triad

# Equations to Know

Wavelength:

\[\lambda = \frac{C}{f}\]

Drt equation:

\[d = rt\]

This is common equation where distance is equal to rate times time.

Open-Open Pipe fundamental:

\[f_1 = \frac{C}{2L}\]

The open-open pipe is also called a half wave resonator, strings also follow the half wave resonation pattern. The overtones follow increasing consecutive integer harmonic multiples. Below is an illustration of the half wave resonator sound waves.

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}

```

Open-Close Pipe fundamental:

\[f_1 = \frac{C}{4L}\]

The open-closed pipe is also called a quarter wave resonator. The overtones follow an increasing consecutive odd integer harmonic multiples. Below is an illustration of the quarter wave resonator sound wave.

```{r, out.width = "400px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./QuarterWaveResonator.jpg")
```
