# Problem 1

## Part 1

```L(R) = (a|b)(a|b)(a|b)```

1. "aaa"
2. "aab"
3. "aba"
4. "abb"
5. "baa"
6. "bab"
7. "bba"
8. "bbb"

## Part 2

```L(R) = a(aa|bb)*b```

This set will be infinite, so I will write down the 7 shortest.

1. "aaab"
2. "abbb"
3. "aaaaab"
4. "aaabbb"
5. "abbbbb"
6. "aaaaaaab"
7. "aaaaabbb"

# Problem 2

## Part 1

Write a regular expression with non empty binaries that start and end with the same digit.

```L(R) = ((1(1|0)*1)|(0(1|0)*0))```
