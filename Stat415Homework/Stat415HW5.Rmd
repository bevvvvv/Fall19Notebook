# Problem 7.4-3

Problem information:

* $\overline{x} = 6.09$
* $s = 0.02$

## Part a

Sample size calculation: sample size needed for $\epsilon = 0.001$ with confidence of $\alpha = 0.1$

Assuming standard deviation is the same for the population we can use the Z value of 1.645 for alpha of 0.1 and plug the numbers into our equation based off a confidence interval:

\[n \geq \frac{z_{\alpha / 2}S^2}{\epsilon^2} = \frac{1.645^2*0.02^2}{0.001^2} = 1082.41\]

Remember we must round up, so we need the sample size to be at least **1,083** samples.

## Part b

With the following numbers we have a decent sample size, and we don't know the distribution, so we use central limit theorem and approximate with a normal distribution:

* $n = 1219$
* $\overline{x} = 6.048$
* $s = 0.022$

Since we looking at the confidecnce level from the last problem, we are still using the same Z value of 1.645. We plug this into our confidence interval formula:

\[\overline{x} +-Z_{\alpha/2}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = 6.048 +- 1.645*\frac{0.022}{\sqrt{1219}}\]

This gives us a confidence interval for mu of **[6.0470, 6.0490]**

## Part c

The problem states that for every 0.01 pounds less the company would save \$14,000 per year. the original sample mean was 6.09 and the new one is around 6.048. This would be a savings of roughly 4.2 * 14,000 = \$58,800.

## Part d

To estimate the proportion of boxes that will weight less than 6 pounds, we want to know P(X < 6). We can use our estimated normal distribution from CLT to come up with a z score of $\frac{6 - 6.048}{0.022} \approx -2.18$.

\[P(X < 6) = P(Z<-2.18) = 1-P(Z<2.18) = 1 - 0.9854 = 0.0146\]

The proportion of boxes measured to be under 6 pounds is now **0.0146**.

# Problem 7.4-7

## Part a

What we know:

* $\epsilon = 0.03$
* $\alpha = 0.05$

What we don't have is any idea of what the actual proportion or a pilot sample proportion would be. We would have to assume the worst with p = 0.5 to maximize possible variance. Z score for a value of 0.025 (half of alpha) is 1.96. We plug this into our formula:

\[n = \frac{Z^2_{\alpha/2}*p(1-p)}{\epsilon^2}=\frac{1.96^2*0.25}{0.03^2} = 1067.11\]

Rounding up we would require a sample size of at least **1,068**.

## Part b

What we know:

* $\epsilon = 0.02$
* $\alpha = 0.05$

What we don't have is any idea of what the actual proportion or a pilot sample proportion would be. We would have to assume the worst with p = 0.5 to maximize possible variance. Z score for a value of 0.025 (half of alpha) is 1.96. We plug this into our formula:

\[n = \frac{Z^2_{\alpha/2}*p(1-p)}{\epsilon^2}=\frac{1.96^2*0.25}{0.02^2} = 2401\]

We would require a sample size of at least **2,401**.

## Part c

What we know:

* $\epsilon = 0.03$
* $\alpha = 0.1$

What we don't have is any idea of what the actual proportion or a pilot sample proportion would be. We would have to assume the worst with p = 0.5 to maximize possible variance. Z score for a value of 0.5 (half of alpha) is 1.645. We plug this into our formula:

\[n = \frac{Z^2_{\alpha/2}*p(1-p)}{\epsilon^2}=\frac{1.645^2*0.25}{0.03^2} = 751.674\]

Rounding up we would require a sample size of at least **752**.

# Problem 7.4-8

What we know:

* $n = 137$
* $y = 54$
* $p^* = 0.3942$
* $\epsilon = 0.04$
* $\alpha = 0.1$

Since we have a study already we can figure out how many samples we need using the variance based off the point estime from the first study. With a Z score value of 1.645 for alpha /2 of 0.5 we can plug into our formula:

\[n = \frac{Z^2_{\alpha/2}*p(1-p)}{\epsilon^2} = \frac{1.645 ^2 * 0.3942 * 0.6058}{0.04^2} = 403.885\]

Rounding up we would require a sample size of at least **404**.


# Problem 6.5-3

## Part a

```{r}
midterms <- c(70, 74, 80, 84, 80, 67, 70, 64, 74, 82)
finals <- c(87, 79, 88, 98, 96, 73, 83, 79, 91, 94)

meanx <- sum(midterms) / 10
meany <- sum(finals) / 10

beta <- sum((finals - meany) * (midterms - meanx)) / sum((midterms - meanx)^2)

print(paste0('Sample mean x: ',meanx))
print(paste0('Sample mean y(alpha): ',meany))
print(paste0('Beta: ',beta))
```

Suppose x denotes the midterm score, which indicates the final score y.

\[y = \alpha + \beta(x - \overline{x})\]
\[\overline{x} = \frac1n\Sigma^n_{i=1}x_i = \frac1{10}*(70 + 74 + ... + 74 + 82) = 74.5\]
\[\alpha = \overline{y} =  \frac1n\Sigma^n_{i=1}y_i = \frac1{10}*(87 + 79 + ... + 91 + 94)=86.8\]
\[\beta = \frac{\Sigma^n_{i=1}(y_i-\overline{y})(x_i-\overline{x})}{\Sigma^n_{i=1}(x_i-\overline{x})^2} = 1.0157\]

This gives us the least squares regression line:

\[y = 86.8 + 1.0157(x - 74.5) = 11.132 + 1.0157x\]

## Part b

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
xVals <- seq(min(midterms), max(midterms), 0.01)
yVals <- meany + beta * (xVals - meanx)
df1 <- data.frame("MidtermScores"=midterms, "FinalScores"=finals)
df2 <- data.frame("RegressionX"=xVals, "RegressionY"=yVals)
df1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=MidtermScores,y=FinalScores)) + geom_point() + geom_line(data=df2,aes(x=RegressionX,y=RegressionY)) +
  ggtitle('Regression of Final Scores vs Midterm Scores')
```

## Part c

The point estimate of the variance for our regression is the sum of squared errors divided by the sample size:

\[\hat{\sigma^2} =\frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^n(y_i-\hat{y_i})}{n} = \frac{179.9981}{10} = 17.99981\]

```{r}
yHats <- meany + beta * (midterms - meanx)
sumError <- sum((finals - yHats)^2)
sigma <- sumError / 10

print(paste0('The sum of squared errors: ', sumError))
print(paste0('The variance estimate: ', sigma))
```
